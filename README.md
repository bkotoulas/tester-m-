It is a construction that is inspired by a video that was shown on my friend's channel. Since in consultation with the colleague, permission was given to use the basic circuit and a part of his video for the construction and presentation of my own project. The above construction resulted, which consists of an OLED screen, an Arduino Nano, an operational amplifier, a switching power supply and some resistors and capacitors. Its function is to measure resistances of the order of mΩ scale. The measurement limits are from 3000mΩ – 10 mΩ. Below you can see the original video from the colleague's channel. Also on GitHub you can find all the files of the construction. I urge you to work on the construction and improve it. Also the program so that we can reach this construction to its maximum operating limits.
